An example of how to make a minigame that could run standalone and also
be loaded into RetroWar as a plugin. Now complete, future development will be in GhostJumpersII.

Once the game has started each player must hit fire on their controller or space on the keyboard to join the game.  To skip levels hit 'N'.

Graphics are based on Simples Pimples art set by [Surt](https://opengameart.org/content/simple-broad-purpose-tileset)
